# First look at deno!

## As a CLI script
Go to the [cli](cli) directory to follow the README for more details of how to run.

### What's good
1. Setup is really fast. Fast project initialisation with typescript, linting, formatting & testing out of the box ready to be used.
2. No node_modules.
3. External library installation is convenient and fast.
4. Developer experience of using the standard library is nice. Similar to NodeJS.
5. Permission functionality is quirky but can see how it can be valuable.
6. Easy to migrate existing NodeJS CLI project over.

TLDR: Feels good to use as a CLI tool with in-built dev tooling to just "set up and go".
